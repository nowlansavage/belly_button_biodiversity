# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Organization
README Folder contains the README file
static folder contains the jason file and a folder called js with holds the app.js script.

I can get this to work in my local python environment but once i try to move it to the github environment it does not work. The code is all correct but just some issues with the deployment.
